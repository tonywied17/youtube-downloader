## Installation Options

The latest release includes four installation options for flexibility and ease of use:

- **Windows Installer Version `*-Setup.exe`**: This option unpacks the application, installs both the GUI and CLI versions, and creates optional shortcuts for easy access. It integrates with your system, making the application easily accessible from the Start Menu and Desktop.

- **Standalone GUI `.zip` (Windows):** A single-file version of the GUI that includes everything needed to run the application without installation. Ideal for portability, this version allows you to launch the application directly, making it easy to move and store across different directories or devices.

- **Standalone CLI `.zip` (Windows):** A single-file version of the CLI that allows you to run the interactive command-line interface without installation. This option is great for users who prefer working directly from the command line and need a portable solution.

- **BUNDLE  Archives `.zip` `.tar.gz` (Windows, Linux):**  Contains both the CLI and GUI standalone executables for Windows, or Linux. **Note:* For the CLI application launch from the terminal using `./yt-cli`

- **Linux BUNDLE `.tar.gz` Archive (GUI and CLI Executables):** A compressed archive containing the Linux version of the applications. Simply extract the contents of the `.tar.gz` file and run the executable within. This option is ideal for Linux users who prefer a standalone application that can be run directly after extraction. **Note:* For the CLI application launch from the terminal using `./yt-cli`
