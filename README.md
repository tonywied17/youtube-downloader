## Installation

### Running the Source Code

If you prefer to run the application from the source code, follow the steps below.

1. **Clone the Repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tonywied17/youtube-downloader.git
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:

   ```bash
   cd youtube-downloader
   ```

3. **Install Python and Dependencies**:

   Install the required Python libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the Interactive CLI Version**:

   Navigate to the `src` directory and run the CLI script:

   ```bash
   cd src/
   python cli.py
   ```

   You can also provide a video URL as an argument:

   ```bash
   python cli.py "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VIDEO_ID"
   ```

   For more detailed instructions, refer to the **Interactive CLI Features** section below.

## Settings Panel

The application includes a settings panel that allows you to configure the following options:
- **Audio Bitrate**: Choose the desired audio bitrate from a predefined list.
- **Output Folder**: Set the folder where downloaded videos and MP3s will be saved. The default is a `downloads/` directory relative to the script location, but you can customize it.

Settings are stored in a `settings.json` file within the same directory as the executable.

## Interactive CLI Features

The CLI version offers an interactive menu for easy video and audio downloading. The menu options are as follows:

```python
print("
Main Menu:")
print("  [1] Download a new video")
print("  [2] Download audio as MP3")
print("  [3] Download an entire playlist (videos)")
print("  [4] Download an entire playlist (audio/mp3)")
print("  [5] View Downloads")
print("  [q] Quit")
```

1. **[1] Download a new video**: Prompts the user to enter a YouTube video URL to download the video.
2. **[2] Download audio as MP3**: Prompts the user for a video URL and extracts the audio as an MP3 file.
3. **[3] Download an entire playlist (videos)**: Prompts the user to enter a playlist URL and downloads all videos.
4. **[4] Download an entire playlist (audio/mp3)**: Prompts the user for a playlist URL and downloads all videos as MP3 files.
5. **[5] View Downloads**: Opens the folder where the downloaded files are saved.
6. **[q] Quit**: Exits the CLI tool.

## Building a New Release (Portable Executable and Installer)

To create a new release that includes both a portable executable (standalone) and an installer version of the YouTube Video Downloader, you can use the `build_release.ps1` PowerShell script. This script automates the entire build process.

### Steps to Run `build_release.ps1`

1. Open PowerShell in the root project directory.
2. Execute the `build_release.ps1` script:

   ```bash
   ./build_release.ps1
   ```

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Clean Build**: Removes existing `dist` and `build` folders to ensure a fresh build.
2. **One-Directory Build**: Generates the one-directory executable with dependencies in the `dist\YouTube Downloader` folder.
3. **Internal Compression**: Compresses the `_internal` directory within the one-directory build for optimized distribution.
4. **Generate `settings.json`**: Creates a default `settings.json` file in the one-directory build with preset configurations.
5. **One-File Executable**: Builds the standalone executable, packaging it as a single file in `dist\YouTube Downloader.exe`.
6. **Portable Zip Creation**: Compresses the one-file executable for a portable release in `dist\YouTube_Downloader_Standalone.zip`.
7. **Installer Creation**: If **Inno Setup** is available, compiles the Inno Setup script to generate a Windows installer in the `installer_scripts` folder.

## Additional Notes

- **Special Character Handling**: The application replaces any special characters in filenames to prevent issues during processing.
- **FFmpeg Bundled**: FFmpeg is bundled with the application, so there is no need for separate installation or configuration.
- **Metadata for MP3 Files**: The MP3 files created from videos will include embedded metadata like title, artist, and album.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the application:
- Ensure `yt-dlp` is installed and up-to-date by running `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`.
- Check that the downloaded FFmpeg binary is correctly bundled with the application.
