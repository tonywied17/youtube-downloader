# Automatic Browser Cookie Import (New Feature)
This application will attempt to import browser cookies required for youtube downloads as well as private and paid videos. 
<br>
## Please ensure that you have...
 - Logged into your youtube account in your browser
 - After logging into youtube, **close all browser windows and tabs**
 - Run the application and it will automatically import the cookies required from your browser to a `cookies.txt` file in your download output folder.

**If you are getting an error message about cookies, please delete any cookies.txt in your output folder and re-follow the steps above.**

**Manually Import:**
 If cookies are not auto-imported, you can manually import them by exporting with a browser extension such as [Get cookies.txt LOCALLY](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/get-cookiestxt-locally/cclelndahbckbenkjhflpdbgdldlbecc) and navigate to youtube.com and login, then export/save the cookies to a `cookies.txt` file in the output folder using the extension.

# Building a New Release (Portable Executable and Installer)

To create a new release that includes both a portable executable (standalone) and an installer version of the YouTube Video Downloader, you can use the `build_release.ps1` PowerShell script. This script automates the entire build process.

## Steps to Run `build_release.ps1`

1. Open PowerShell in the root project directory.
2. Execute the `build_release.ps1` script:

   ```bash
   ./build_release.ps1
   ```

The script performs the following tasks:
1. **Clean Build**: Removes existing `dist` and `build` folders to ensure a fresh build.
2. **One-Directory Build**: Generates the one-directory executable with dependencies in the `dist\YouTube Downloader` folder.
3. **Internal Compression**: Compresses the `_internal` directory within the one-directory build for optimized distribution.
4. **Generate `settings.json`**: Creates a default `settings.json` file in the one-directory build with preset configurations.
5. **One-File Executable**: Builds the standalone executable, packaging it as a single file in `dist\YouTube Downloader.exe`.
6. **Portable Zip Creation**: Compresses the one-file executable for a portable release in `dist\YouTube_Downloader_Standalone.zip`.
7. **Installer Creation**: If **Inno Setup** is available, compiles the Inno Setup script to generate a Windows installer in the `installer_scripts` folder.

# Additional Notes

- **Special Character Handling**: The application replaces any special characters in filenames to prevent issues during processing.
- **FFmpeg Bundled**: FFmpeg is bundled with the application, so there is no need for separate installation or configuration.
- **Metadata for MP3 Files**: The MP3 files created from videos will include embedded metadata like title, artist, and album.

# Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the application:
- Ensure `yt-dlp` is installed and up-to-date by running `pip install --upgrade yt-dlp`.
- Check that the downloaded FFmpeg binary is correctly bundled with the application.
